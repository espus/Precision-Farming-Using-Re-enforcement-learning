# Precision-Farming-Using-Argumented-Intelligence
Farming is one of the world's solution to most existing problems..Food shortages and water shortages. Precision farming is therefore vital in such a way that it solves problems of water shortages but maximizing yield 
Digitization of data collection processes in the crop fields will be at the heart of the next agricultural revolution. But this will take time, especially when taking into account that most farmers or agronomists are still using pen and paper to collect data. 

This is bound to change due to the increasing amount of useful data points that are emerging from all types of tools. Sensors, cameras, robots, drones and other artifacts deliver an increasing amount of data that is exponentially richer in quality and quantity. What’s more, the data brings insights in real time, with devices that are on the ground 24/7. However, other challenges such as data orchestration emerge. 

With so many sources of data and insights, how can we expect food growers to streamline all the different streams of data and create a single source of truth to help them inform their decision-making process?

A recent report by USDA’s Economic Research Service on Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators highlighted the introduction of precision agriculture technologies. Variable-rate technologies (VRTs) enable farmers to make customized land management decisions to optimize the use of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. This allows farmers to manage inputs foot by foot, with an unprecedented level of precision. The report showed that by 2016, between 15% and 40% of farms in the U.S already used variable-rate application equipment.
